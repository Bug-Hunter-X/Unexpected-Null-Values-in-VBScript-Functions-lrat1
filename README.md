This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to the handling of Null values. The `bug.vbs` file contains a function that returns Null if it receives empty arguments. This can cause runtime errors if the caller doesn't explicitly check for Null before using the returned value. The `bugSolution.vbs` file shows how to handle this using proper error checking and alternative return values.
